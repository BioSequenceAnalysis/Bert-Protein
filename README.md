# Introduction
This is a model for antimicrobial peptides recognition based on BERT which is proposed.
We pretrained a BERT model through amount of proteins sequences downloaded from UniPort.
We train the model on 4 datasets and evaluate its performance.
We merge all the datasets and train a model.
# How to Start
You should first clone the project by command
'''
git clone https://github.com/JianyuanLin/Bert-Protein
''' 
Then you need to download models and datasets from follow address:
 
 
 # Pre-training
 # Fine-Tuning & Evaluation & Save Model
 # Predict
