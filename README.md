# Introduction
This is a model for antimicrobial peptides recognition based on BERT which is proposed.
We pretrained a BERT model through amount of proteins sequences downloaded from UniPort.
We train the model on 4 datasets and evaluate its performance.
We merge all the datasets and train a model.
